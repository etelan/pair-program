A User Story describes one thing a program is expected to do, from the perspective of somebody using that program. When planning a program, the client's requirements will be decomposed into many User Stories. Much of a developer's life is spent translating User Stories into a functional system. In Object-Oriented Programming, these systems are made up of Objects and Messages. Objects describe the objects within the system, and Messages describe how those objects interact. We call these systems Domain Models.


You must translate these two user stories into a functional representation:

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

To complete this challenge, you will need to:
 Write down all the nouns in the User Stories
 Write down all the verbs in the User Stories
 Draw a table like the one above
 Organise the nouns and verbs into Objects and Messages within the table
 Draw a diagram that shows how your Objects will use Messages to communicate with one another
